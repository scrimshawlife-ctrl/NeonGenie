# Neon Genie Eval Rubric (skeleton)

Wave 1 captures invariants for later automated runners. Fixtures live in `evals/cases/`.

## Global invariants

1. Missing executable evidence → `NOT_COMPUTABLE` (never fabricate).
2. High monetization or memetic strength cannot override authority, evidence, integration, or anti-capture gate failures.
3. x402 rejected when ornamental or when conventional billing is superior.
4. Zero Option never invents unavailable skills, capital, or access.
5. Wayfinder execution packet cannot modify product intent; intent changes require Neon Genie review.
6. No packet grants execution, spending, or publishing authority.
7. Same canonical input + profile set → structurally stable labeled outputs (Wave 2+ determinism checks).
8. Proactive research is default; offline / `research.enabled=false` skips live fetches.
9. Model prior without fetch is at most `SPECULATIVE`.
10. Gate P — public material gaps with host tools require a research attempt before OBSERVED / NOT_COMPUTABLE / INFERRED.
11. Gate Q — private decision-critical gaps require a DataRequest; open requests cap promotion.
12. Gate R — silent invent of private facts as OBSERVED is forbidden.
